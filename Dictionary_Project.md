Dictionary Project:

1. The dictionary should be able to add, remove, search and display words saved  (push()/pop() from an array, 2D array/tuple as the structure of dictionary)
2. The dictionary should have a terminal-based interface (like a shell)
3. The dictionary should have a hash function to allow easier searching
4. It should save the words in the dictionary in between instances of the process (save() and load() functions that save and load the state of the array into and from a file)
5. Compare the performance of the C dictionary with a Java dictionary (can be taken from the Data Structures book) (Not necessiary if we implement a full-functional C-dictionary)
